# Midterm Password Generator

This repository contains the starter scaffold for your Midterm Password Generator. You'll build the password generator features during Weeks 15–16. For now, the code runs and prints a welcome message so you can verify your environment and practice Git.

## Project Structure
- `README.md`: Project overview and how files fit together.
- `.gitignore`: Keeps secret or junk files out of your repository.
- `main.py`: Entry point for the password generator app (prints a welcome message for now).
- `utils.py`: Utility function stubs you'll use as you build features.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you've completed the Git setup and initial commits per the Week 14 Instructions.
2. Run the entry point to verify Python runs the script (prints a welcome message):
```
python3 main.py
```
You should see a welcome message.

## Notes
- Initial Git setup was completed in Week 14 (init, add, commit, push). From Week 15 onward, you'll start implementing the password generator features.
- Keep commits small and messages clear as you develop.
